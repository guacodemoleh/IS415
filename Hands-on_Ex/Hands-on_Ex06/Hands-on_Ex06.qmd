These exercises trains on the collection of geospatial statistical methods specially designed for meaasuring global and local spatial association.

These spatial statistics are well suited for: - detecting clusters or outliers - identifying hot spot or cold spot areas - assessing the assumptions of stationarity - identifying distances beyond which no discernible association obtains.

# A. Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (Hunan)

## Overview

In Section A, we are learning how to compute Global and Local Measure of SPatial Autocorrelation (GSLA) by using the **spdep** package. The aim of this exercise is to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package,

    -   plot Moran scatterplot,

    -   compute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of **spdep** package

-   compute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers by using appropriate functions **spdep** package

-   compute Getis-Ord's Gi-statistics for detecting hot spot and/or cold spot area by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package, and

-   to visualise the analysis output by using tmap package.

## Getting Started

### Asking ourselves

Policymakers need to verify if development has been evenly distributed or implemented within a county or province. Thus, this study involves the application of appropriate spatial statistical methods if the development is evenly distributed geographically.

If the answer to that is **no**, then we should observe if there is the presence of spatial clustering. If the answer to this question is **yes**, then we should check where are these clusters.

We are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Province, the People's Republic of China.

### The Study Area and Data

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise:

-   Hunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.

-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunanâ€™s local development indicators in 2012.

### Setting the Analytical Tools

Before starting, ensure that **spdep**, **sf**, **tmap** and **tidyverse** packages of R are installed.

-   sf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,

-   tidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,

-   spdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and

-   tmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
